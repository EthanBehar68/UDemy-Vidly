The work I did when going through Mosh Hamedani's ASP.NET MVC 5 course.

I bought and completed this course to gain experience working with ASP.NET MVC 5. At this point it is now deprecated and ASP.NET Core has replaced it. But as a stepping stone to learning ASP.NET Core Mosh Hamedani suggested going through this course before doing his ASP.NET Core course which I intend to do. Also it is not entirely useless as many companies are likely to have legacy applications that aren't updated to ASP.NET Core and still require maintenance and support.

This project is a video rental application. By the end of this course, I'll will have done: 
 * Implement CRUD operations
 * Build forms with validation 
 * Build RESTful services using ASP.NET Web API
 * Use Entity Framework code-first workflow to build a model 
 * Implement security, authentication and authorization using ASP.NET Identity
 * Use powerful jQuery plugins
 * Optimize application's performance  
 * Build and deploy your applications 
 * And much more...

# Extra Challenges Completed

At the end of the course Mosh Hamedani gave some extra challenges. I finished them as best as I could. Although there aren't any resources to inform me how well/practical my approach at solving these problems were. 

* Add the ability for end users to check movies in.
* Add the logic to limit how many movies a customer can have rented at one time.
* Add the ability to allow end users mark customers as delinquent on payment as well as the ability to remove this flag. This could be used so that these customers cannot rent movies until they are no longer delinquent on payment.
* Add the ability to allow end users to apply a discounted rate to customers.
* Add the ability to allow end users to maintain both users and roles through the user interface. This probably should be limited to an Admin role.
