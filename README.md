The work I did when going through Mosh Hamedani's ASP.NET MVC 5 course.

I bought and going through this course to gain experience working with ASP.NET MVC 5. At this point it is now deprecated and ASP.NET Core has replaced it. But as a stepping stone to learning ASP.NET Core Mosh Hamedani suggested going through this course before doing his ASP.NET Core course which I intend to do. Also it is not entirely useless as many companies are likely to have legacy applications that aren't updated to ASP.NET Core and still require maintenance and support.

This project is a video rental application. By the end of this course, I'll will have done: 
 * Implement CRUD operations
 * Build forms with validation 
 * Build RESTful services using ASP.NET Web API
 * Use Entity Framework code-first workflow to build a model 
 * Implement security, authentication and authorization using ASP.NET Identity
 * Use powerful jQuery plugins
 * Optimize application's performance  
 * Build and deploy your applications 
 * And much more...
